"""BabbleSim session lifecycle and the standalone simulation clock.

Covers ``BabbleSimSession`` and ``BabbleSimClock``:

- a session reuses an existing Host loop (no own clock) or, when a clock device
  is configured, binds a ``RadioEventLoop`` only after the startup barrier and
  unbinds it before stopping workers;
- startup and shutdown order: all workers are started and, on failure or exit,
  every worker is closed before the Host grant is released;
- duplicate controller or clock device identities are rejected, and an empty
  topology is rejected;
- ``BabbleSimClock.advance_to_us`` advances only after the PHY acknowledges and
  rejects non-monotonic targets.

Fake workers use ``SimpleNamespace`` with ``AsyncMock``; the ``endpoints``
fixture supplies a FIFO-backed clock/PHY pair.
