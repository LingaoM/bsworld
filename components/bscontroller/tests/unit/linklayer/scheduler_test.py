"""Half-open reservations, quantized gaps and fixed-priority admission.

Covers the radio scheduler primitives that place and arbitrate radio events on
one timeline:

- ``RadioReservation.window_after`` rolls a periodic window at its exclusive
  end, so an endpoint is in the active window but not the next one.
- ``first_radio_gap`` finds the earliest admissible start on a request-relative
  microsecond grid, checking the full duration against every reservation.
- ``higher_priority_overlap`` arbitrates overlaps using half-open windows and a
  fixed ``RadioPriority`` order.

These are arithmetic invariants; how connection, advertising and scanning
roles use the scheduler on air is covered by ``linklayer/air/``.
