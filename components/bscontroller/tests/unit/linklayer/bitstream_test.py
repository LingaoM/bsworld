"""Access Address generation and CRC-24 against fixed vectors.

Protects two bit-exact invariants used when a connection is created (Core Vol 6,
Part B, 2.1.2 and 3.1.1):

- ``generate_access_address`` yields values that satisfy every Access Address
  constraint, including the stricter LE Coded PHY rules, and is reproducible
  from a seeded ``random.Random`` so that scenarios replay identically. The
  bit-string checks live in ``tests.unit.helpers.check_access_address``.
- ``crc24`` matches an independent radio model over empty, sample and maximal
  PDUs.

Higher-level advertising/connection wire vectors live in ``advertising_test.py``
and ``parameters_test.py``.

    """Generated Access Addresses pass every constraint and replay from a seed.

    Purpose: Verify that ``generate_access_address`` produces values meeting the
    Access Address rules for all PHYs, including LE Coded (Vol 6, Part B,
    2.1.2), never repeats a value already in use, and yields the same sequence
    for the same seed so scenarios are deterministic.

    Steps:
        1. Seed a ``random.Random(17)`` and an empty set of used values.
        2. Generate 1000 addresses, each validated by ``check_access_address``,
           recording each value and marking it used so it cannot recur.
        3. Re-seed a fresh ``random.Random(17)`` and regenerate the sequence
           from an empty used set.

    Expected:
        - Every generated value satisfies the bit-string oracle.
        - The replay from the same seed reproduces the identical list.
