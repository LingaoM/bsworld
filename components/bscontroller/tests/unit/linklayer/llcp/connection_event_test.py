"""Connection event execution and connection lifetime (Core Vol 6, Part B, 4.5).

These scenarios run the real ``Connection.advance_to_us`` event loop on the fake
radio: establishment, supervision, T_terminate, missed events, channel selection,
transmit windows and exchange budgeting. Each test states one rule.

Axes: {establishment (4.5.2, 4.5.5), supervision (4.5.2), T_terminate (5.1.6),
Peripheral event (4.5.5, 4.5.6), missed events and radio conflicts, channel
selection (CSA#1/#2) and exchange budget}. They use the Lower Tester / Upper
Tester harness (llcp/harness.py) for the Host side and fixtures, but drive the
connection event loop and radio directly rather than the step vocabulary.
