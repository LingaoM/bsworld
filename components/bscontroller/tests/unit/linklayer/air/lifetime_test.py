"""Role lifetimes on one shared radio (Core Vol 6, Part B, 4.4; implementation
ownership rules).

A role context can be released by the Host, or replaced by a callback, while an
RF exchange for it is still in flight. These scenarios pin the rule that a stale
context can never commit a connection, a sync or a report, and that radio
arbitration skips events without corrupting counters or timeouts.

Invariants:
    - A released, disabled, reset or replaced advertiser cannot commit a
      connection from a delayed CONNECT_IND or AUX_CONNECT_REQ.
    - A delayed scan/initiation/sync result cannot complete a newer context, and
      a completion callback cannot act on a context freed during the callback.
    - Radio arbitration yields an event (connection, periodic TX/RX) without
      refreshing timers or desynchronizing event counters.
    - Wire identities (access address, CRC init, hop, window offset) are seeded,
      bounded, unique among live owners and reproducible after reset.

Most tests drive a ``RadioLink`` over the ``air/harness.py`` ScriptedRadio with a
``Recorder`` standing in for the HCI listener, so lifetime ordering is observed as
``on_*`` callbacks rather than HCI events; a few exercise the pure backoff and
resource-manager helpers directly. The on-air role behaviour these races guard
is covered in the other ``air/`` files.

def test_periodic_enable_without_free_phase_keeps_nominal_anchor(link):
    """Enabling a periodic train with no free phase keeps the nominal anchor.

    Purpose: With no gap in the next interval the train starts one interval later
    and yields to the arbiter event by event, keeping the nominal anchor and a
    valid seeded access address; re-enabling an already-enabled train changes
    nothing (Vol 6, Part B, 4.4.2.12).

    Steps:
        1. Publish an extended advertiser with a periodic interval.
        2. Make the resource manager report a full-schedule reservation.
        3. Enable the periodic train at now = 1000 us.
        4. Enable it again.

    Expected:
        - The train is enabled with its next anchor one interval after now and a
          valid access address.
        - Re-enabling leaves the next anchor unchanged.
