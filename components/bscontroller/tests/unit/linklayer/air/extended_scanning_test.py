scripts an ADV_EXT_IND on a primary channel followed by AUX_ADV_IND /
AUX_CHAIN_IND / AUX_SCAN_RSP / AUX_CONNECT_RSP on the auxiliary channel, offset
by their AuxPtr. ``status_of`` reads the Data Status field of an extended report
(COMPLETE / INCOMPLETE / TRUNCATED). The advertiser side lives in
``extended_advertising_test.py``, periodic synchronization in
``periodic_test.py``.
