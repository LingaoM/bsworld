HCI commands and reads events, ``lt_tx`` scripts a peer PDU in the IUT's next
listen window, ``lt_rx`` reads the IUT's transmissions, and ``run`` advances the
shared clock. Extended advertising lives in ``extended_advertising_test.py``;
the scanner and initiator sides live in ``legacy_scanning_test.py``.
